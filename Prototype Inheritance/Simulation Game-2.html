<!--Task : Imagine you are developing a simulation game that involves various kinds of vehicles. Using the concepts of inheritance, prototype chains, and object-oriented design patterns learned in class.
//Instructions:
//Create a basic Vehicle constructor function that initializes properties like brand, model, speed, and fuelType.

//Using the prototype, add common methods to the Vehicle object like accelerate(), brake(), and refuel().

//accelerate() should increase the speed of the vehicle.
//brake() should decrease the speed.
//refuel() should log a message indicating the vehicle is refueling.
Now, create a Car constructor function. The Car function should inherit properties and methods from the Vehicle object. Additionally, Car should have an extra property numberOfWheels and a method honk() that logs a honking sound.

Similarly, create an Airplane constructor function that inherits from Vehicle. It should have properties numberOfEngines and hasLandingGear and a method takeOff() that logs a message indicating the airplane is taking off.

Show how you would create a new instance of Car and Airplane, and demonstrate invoking their methods, ensuring that both types of vehicles can still accelerate, brake, and refuel through their prototype chain-->
